# Identifying-Triangles
### This was a program created from a project where we were to implement any of the fundamental python concepts to write a code that would be relevant in the mathematics field.
#### This program allows the user to input the sides of a triangle for it to determine which type of triangle ir is(i.e equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or right-angled).
#### Though a simple program, it has been used by several elementary students in my town which saves time when contemplating what type of triangle one is working on.

#### Language used: Python
#### No external software/technologies needed to run the code
